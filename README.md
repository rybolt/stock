* this project uses real data (stock historical data on the daily timeframe)
  * data imported into sql via csv processing and Entity framework code first using migrations
  * exposing it via an API which will implement .net core mvc api
  * supplying a UI to analyze the said data which will utilize Angular v.19
 

 note: this is a work in progress and is intended as a hobby project for fun; and learning resource for others. 
  => a way to share code to whomever I want. this cannot be done with other code I work on with private entities.
